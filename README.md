# YBI-cancer-prediction
Machine Learning project for breast cancer prediction using Logistic Regression
# 🧠 Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a tumor is **malignant (cancerous)** or **benign (non-cancerous)** using machine learning techniques.  
It was developed as part of the **YBI Foundation Python Programming Internship**.

## 👩‍💻 Project By

**Name:** Ayushi Sinha  
**Internship:** YBI Foundation – Python Programming & Machine Learning

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning model using logistic regression that can accurately classify breast cancer tumors based on features extracted from cell images.

---

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`
- Contains **569 records** with **30 features** (mean, texture, radius, etc.)
- Target values:
  - `0` → Malignant
  - `1` → Benign

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- Google Colab ☁️  
- Pandas, Numpy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. Data loading and exploration  
2. Feature selection and preprocessing  
3. Model building using Logistic Regression  
4. Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)  
5. Predicting on sample data  

---

## 📈 Results

- **Accuracy:** ~95.61%  
- The model is effective in identifying cancerous tumors with high precision.
